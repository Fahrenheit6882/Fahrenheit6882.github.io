# Docusaurus

[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) is a [static site generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator). This is a fancy way of saying that it's a program that is used to to produce `html`, `css`, and `javascript` code based on a bunch of text files you have written to describe how you want your website to look and behave. 

## Node.js

Docusaurus is written using Javascript. Javascript code must be interpreted in order to do stuff. A web browser can interpret and execute javascript code. Node.js can also interpret and execute javascript code. 

In order to use Docusaurus, you must have Node.js installed on your computer. 

Once you have Node.js installed, you can run the following command to install docusaurus: 

```
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic --typescript
