# First Robotics Fahrenheit Team Website

This is a [Git Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) that contains all the source code for our Team's website

## Making Changes

All the files in this repository are simple text files. You can use any text editor program you want to change these files. But, I suggest you use VS Code, which is a editor program build specficially to edit source code text files. 

Learn how to Download and Install VS Code here:

Once you have VS Code installed, you will need to download the files you see here to your computer.
