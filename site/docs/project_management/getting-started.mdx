# Getting Access

We use [github](https://github.com) to manage tasks and projects. Our projects and task repositories are private so that only members of the team can see them. 

[Click here](https://github.com/Fahrenheit6882/Project-Planning) to check if you have access. If you can see our `Project-Planning` repository and can click on `Issues` then you should be good to go. 

Otherwise, you'll need to [signup](https://github.com/signup) to create a github account. Once you have signed up, reach out on [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/505146464037634050) and ask to be granted access to the Github Project Planning Repsitory.
