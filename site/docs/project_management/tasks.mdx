# Tasks

Anytime you think of something cool that the Team should work on, that's a task. For example: 

> "I think we should build a shooter!"

> "We need a more noodles for bumpers"

> "Let's organize a trip to funland"

> "I think we should get a chocolate fountain for the open house!"

These are all tasks :-)
