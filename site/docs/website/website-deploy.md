## Start a Development Server to test local changes

When you edit the files in VS Code installed on your computer, only you can see the changes that you've made.

## Deploy Changes

When you're happy with the changes, you will need to push the changed files back to github. 

:::note
When you use `git` to upload changed files, the command that is run is called `git push`. So, you will often hear developers talk about `pushing` their code to github.

Whenever new or changed files are pushed to github, then the "Live" site available here will show the changes:
