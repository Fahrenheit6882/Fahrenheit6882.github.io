# Robot Software

## Install the Driver Station

You must have Windows to run the Driver Station. 

Download the Driver Station software from [the Ni roboRIO FRC Game Tools Page](https://www.ni.com/en/support/downloads/drivers/download.frc-game-tools.html)

## WPLib

In order to make electronics like the roboRIO, sensors, and motor controllers do stuff, you will need to write software. You could write this software 
from scratch but that would be a ton of work. The [WPLib](https://wpilib.org/) is a software development kit (SDK) that provides code to control electronics. 

:::note
Ever wonder what the `WP` in `WPLib` stands for? [Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)](https://wpilib.org/aboutwpi) is a University in Massachusetts. WPILib was written by some folks at WPI in 2005 as a way to level the playing field and give a strong foundation for all teams to work from.
