# Javascript

Javascript is a full, [turing complete](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_complete), programming language. In other words, you can use Javascript to write any program that you can dream up. 

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is a javascript runtime, which means, you can use `Node.js` to run javascript programs. Javascript is probably most famous for being used to develop Web sites. In fact, browsers can run a subset of javascript.

[Here's a tutorial about Javascript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)

:::tip

Want to try running some javascript? Most browsers have a javascript console built right in. For example, in Chrome, try right clicking anywhere on a page and choose `inspect`. That should open a new window. Choose `Console`. Then put your cursor inside the console and type `alert('Hola!');` and click enter. You should see an alert pop up :-)

# Install Node.js

## Node Version Manager

The Node Version Manager can be used to easily install different versions of `Node.js`. 

Follow [this guide here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/) to install Node Version Manager. 

If installed correctly, you should be able to run this the `nvm` command from a terminal like this: 

```shell
$ nvm list

    23.2.0
  * 22.3.0 (Currently using 64-bit executable)
```

## Install Node.js (and Node Package Manager, npm)

Use the `nvm` command to install node version 22.3.0 like this: 

```shell
nvm install 22.3.0
```

Once Node is installed you should be able to run the `node` command from a terminal like this: 

```shell
$ node
Welcome to Node.js v22.3.0.
Type ".help" for more information.
```

You should also be able to run `npm` like this: 

```shell
$ npm --version
10.8.1

```

## Auto update Node

You can follow this tutorial <a href="https://github.com/Liveeee7219/Update-Node">here.</a>

## Install Yarn

[yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) is an example of a Dependency, Package Management, and Build Tool. It's a program written in javascript that helps you to manage and run javascript code.

:::note

Each programming language typically has it's own build tools. Probably the O.G build tool is [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). For example, java programmers use [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and/or [gradle](https://gradle.org/). Python uses [pip](https://packaging.python.org/). Javascript, for some reason, has a bunch of tools, for example: `npm` and `yarn`. 

:::

To install `yarn` run the following command from a terminal: 

```shell
npm install --global yarn
```

If `yarn` is installed, you should be able to run `yarn` like this: 

```shell
$ yarn --version
1.22.22
```
