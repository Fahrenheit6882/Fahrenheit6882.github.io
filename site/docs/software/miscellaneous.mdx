# Miscellaneous

## Windows PowerToys

If you're weird like me, you might like to swap your `CTRL` key with your `Caps Lock` key. [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/) makes it easy to change key mappings and it also looks like it has a lot of other nice advanced tools. 

## OBS

The [Open Broadcast Software (OBS)](https://obsproject.com) makes it possible to record autio and video from your laptop for free!
