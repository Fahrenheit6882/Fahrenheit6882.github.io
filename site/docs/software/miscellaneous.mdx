# Miscellaneous

## Windows PowerToys

If you're weird like me, you might like to swap your `CTRL` key with your `Caps Lock` key. [PowerToys](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerToys/releases/) makes it easy to change key mappings and it also looks like it has a lot of other nice advanced tools. 

## OBS

The [Open Broadcast Software (OBS)](https://obsproject.com) makes it possible to record autio and video from your laptop for free!

## Chocolatey

Downloading, installing, and keeping software updated on Windows can be challenging. Chocolatey is software to help you manage software. 

Other operating systems such as Linux, have their own package managers. Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows

## Maven

When you write java code, you can use `javac` to compile it and then run it with the `java` command. This works
great for simple programs that fit into a single text file. You can even package your code into a Java Archive, aka `jar` file, and run it that way. 

However, it quickly becomes tedious to manually call `javac` to compile multiple java and jar files. This is where maven can help.

Here's the [maven installation guide](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

You can use [chocolatey](#chocolatey) to install maven on Windows by Running Powershell as Administrator and run: `choco install maven`

:::note
Gradle is another popular java build tool that was inspired by Maven. If you are starting a new java project you can use either Maven or Gradle to build and manage your project. Maven uses `xml` to know how to compile and manage java projects. Gradle uses the `groovy` programming language. The `groovy` programming language is another language that can run on the Java virtual machine (JVM). [WPLib](/software/miscellaneous.mdx#wplib) uses `Gradle` to build and deploy Robot code written in Java
